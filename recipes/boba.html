    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><em>Chadol baegi</em>, a staple of Korean BBQ, is thinly shaved beef brisket. 
        Unlike other Korean meat favorites that hit the grill, 
        the brisket is not marinated. Instead, it's cooked quickly on the grill and 
        then dipped in a sauce of sesame oil, salt, and pepper. 
        You can buy the thinly sliced brisket at Korean markets, 
        ask your butcher to shave the brisket for you, or cut it yourself.</p>
