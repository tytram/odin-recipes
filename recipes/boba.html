    <h2>What is Milk Tea Boba?</h2>

    <p><strong><em>Bubble tea </em></strong>consists of sweetened tea with chewy black tapioca balls, often referred to as pearls or boba. There are endless drink variations, 
        from fruit flavorings to milk alternatives to rainbow-colored boba. There's no shortage of fun and unique boba drinks!</p>

        <p>However, the classic black milk tea is the most basic and popular. It simply consists of brewed black tea, milk creamer, and sweetener. 
        It's a delicious thirst quencher that's both smooth and decadent. Make it yourself and you'll see just how easy and simple it is!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Tapioca boba (pearls)</li>
        <li>Black tea</li>
        <li>Half and half</li>
        <li>Syrup </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and and add the boba. Stir for 1 minute to prevent the pearls from sticking to the bottom of the pan. If needed, turn the heat down so it's at a rolling simmer. Cover with a lid and cook the tapioca pearls for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Make sure the boba is fully submerged in water, adding more water if needed.</li>
        <li>After the initial 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let the boba rest for 30 minutes. No peeking!</li>
        <li>After the rest time, strain the boba and rinse briefly with cold water.</li>
        <li>While the boba is cooking, boil 2Â¼ cups water. Add the tea bags (or leaves) and steep for 4-5 minutes. Discard the bags/leaves and let cool. You should have 2 cups of black tea.</li>
        <li>While the boba is cooking, also make the syrup. Add white sugar, brown sugar, honey, and water to a pot and heat gently until everything is dissolved. Pour into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the strained warm boba to the syrup. Let sit for 30 minutes so it can absorb the flavor.</li>
        <li>Get everything ready to assemble your classic bubble milk tea! You'll needed the boba in syrup, black tea, half and half, and ice.</li>
    </ol>
